# Number_Combination_Generator
Number_Combination_Generator is a program that enumerates the shortest formula for a set of integers, consisting of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, and user input numbers. 

It aims to provide a dictionary for homo-calculator.

The implementation method is to first run all possible combinations in python and leave the shortest positive integer formula.
